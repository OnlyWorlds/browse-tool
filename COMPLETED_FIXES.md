# Completed Fixes and Improvements

## Security Fix
✅ **PIN Storage** - Changed from localStorage to sessionStorage
- PIN is now stored only for the browser session
- World key remains in localStorage for convenience
- More secure approach for sensitive credentials

## Feature Implementations

### ✅ Reverse Link Display System (Task 007)
- Created `reverseLinks.ts` utility with:
  - `calculateReverseLinks()` - Scans all elements for references
  - `getFieldLabel()` - Provides friendly relationship labels
  - `groupReverseLinks()` - Groups by relationship type
- Created `ReverseLinkSection` component that:
  - Shows all elements that reference the current element
  - Groups by relationship type (e.g., "Located in", "Member of")
  - Provides navigation to referencing elements
  - Uses memoization for performance
- Added comprehensive tests (9 new tests)
- Integrated into ElementViewer below main fields

### ✅ Delete Element UI Functionality
- Added delete button in ElementViewer (edit mode only)
- Implemented confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion
- Handles API call to delete element
- Updates local state and navigates home after deletion
- Shows loading state during deletion
- Error handling with user feedback
- Added comprehensive tests (6 new tests)

### ✅ Code Quality Improvements
- Removed debug console.log statement from ElementViewer
- Fixed all TypeScript type safety issues
- Added proper error handling

## Test Coverage
- All 130 tests passing
- Added 20 new tests for new features
- Build completes successfully

## Remaining High Priority Issues

### 1. Validation System
- No schema validation before saving elements
- Missing field-level error display
- No validation feedback to users

### 2. PDF Export for Showcase Mode
- Showcase mode exists but no export functionality
- Missing field toggle/exclude functionality
- No preference persistence

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Element filtering recalculates on every render
- No React.memo usage for components
- Missing virtualization for long lists

## Summary
The codebase now has improved security with sessionStorage for PINs, a fully functional reverse link display system showing element relationships, and complete CRUD operations with the addition of element deletion. The code is cleaner with debug statements removed and all tests passing.
